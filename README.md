# EDVocab
EdVocab is an HTML app created in Twine that allows the user to review vocabulary words with pictures and pronunciation mp3 files. 

Download only the EDVocab_X-X.zip file. Unzip the file. There is a single HTML file inside. Run the HTML file in your browser and learn or teach.

If you are so inclined to make your own word list, you may. You need to aquire your own pictures or royalty free pictures. You also need to creat sound files like MP3s.
I used Audacity (and open source recording and sound editing software) to record the sound files. Github is a great repository for the picture and sound files. All you need 
to do is copy the raw link of each file once they are loaded into Github and paste them in the appropriate spot under the DATA passage. Oh yes. You edit EDVocab in an application 
called Twine which you can download for free at twinery.org.
